Usage:
WaveAudio w = new WaveAudio("file.wav");
Console.WriteLine(w.LengthInSeconds);
w.Amplify(1.5); // make it a bit louder.
w.SaveWaveFile("output.wav");

WaveAudio alteredSound = Effects.Vibrato(w);

Sine sine = new Sine(440.0, 0.5); // 440Hz, at half volume
WaveAudio note = sine.CreateAudio(1.0); //generate 1 second of audio

Triangle synth = new Sine(Sine.FreqFromMidiNote(60)); // middle C
WaveAudio note = synth.CreateAudio(1.0); //generate 1 second of audio
